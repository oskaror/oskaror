<h3 align="center">A passionate Backend Developer</h3>

I’m a passionate Backend Developer with over 11 years of experience building scalable, user-focused products using Ruby, Elixir and modern architectures like microservices, domain-driven design, and event-driven systems. All this while spending my free time on pursuing other tech oriented interests and sport. My journey blends a passion for technology with a continuous drive for self-improvement:

- 🚀 **Products Enthusiast**: I love building thoughtful, user-focused products that solve real problems.
- 🤖 **AI Explorer**: Exploring the intersection of AI and app development, I create projects that push the boundaries of user experiences.
- 🏆 **Paintball Player**: I enjoy paintball for the adrenaline, team work and strategy — it keeps my mind sharp and competitive.
